Planned features:
- More selector exclusion specificity will be added as needed. Currently `img, video, svg, canvas, object, map` elements are whitelisted (blacklisted?).
- More "intelligent" darkination (background/foreground contrast checks, neighbouring elements' shade comparison).
- Adding settings for modes/levels/styles of darkination.
- Exclude page elements that are already dark (currently these elements will be no longer dark, which is terrible).
